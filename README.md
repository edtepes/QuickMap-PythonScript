# QuickMap-PythonScript

QuickMap.py - Fast mapping straight from your OS to automate the Google Maps searching process saving you keystrokes on your weekend getaway planning. 

Menu Options:

Paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V) + Enter - finds your default browser and prefills Google Maps to
get directions from your saved address to your pasted address.

Set Address - sets a new address, overwriting the old address.

Show Address - shows you the currently saved address. 

Erase Address - erases your old address and sets the current address to ''. This may 
seem redundant as Set Address overwrites files anyways, however on startup the program lets
you know if you have a currently saved address or not and the only way it will say you 
currently have no saved address is if your address is set to ''.

# TODO: Make this program cross-platform.
